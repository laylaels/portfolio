<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>
	I'm Layla El-Sekaifi, a {AGE} years-old multidisciplinary artist, retoucher and
	video editor based in {LOCATION}.
</p>
<p>
	For the past 8 years I have been familiarising myself with the Adobe Suite,
	mainly focussing on Photoshop but ranging through to Lr Pr Ae Id.
</p>
<p>
	I have been working daily with LightRoom and Photoshop since 2020 as a
	retoucher and designer for real estate clients bringing their properties to
	life and preparing their marketing materials.
</p>
<p>
	As of recent I have taken an interest in 3D, familiarising myself with the
	software, concepts and creating models in my free time.
</p>
<p>
	When Iâ€™m not working you can find me drawing, discovering new things, swimming, and having a good time with friends or family :)
</p>
